# COMS-327
This is the pokemon game I created over the course of my time in COMS 327 (one semester) at ISU in the Spring of 2023. The changelog breaks down my progress 
on the game week by week and describes when I accomplished major steps. The game parces information from the pokedex file that was provided by the professor 
which I have added to this repo.
