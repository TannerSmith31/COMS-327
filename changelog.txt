4/19/23: 3:33am
    >had an epiphany (though long rooted) on what to do for my project

4/20/23: 10:00pm
    >made some pseudocode on how to generate a random maze
    >solidified more details of the Catacombs such as having the doors open once you press a button and having each map travel 4 maps in the overworld

4/21/23: 11:00pm
    >updated my map constructor to create catacomb entrances if the map's world map position was divisible by 4
    >combined my generateMap() function into the constructor of my map class (ive been wanting to do that since we switched to C++)
    >made a class for the catacombs and made code to generate the doors between them (simmilar to gates in the overworld)
    >made a class that will help me create the catacomb maze.
    >updated my printboard() function to print out graves and catacomb entrances.
    >got the catacomb constructor to kinda make paths from the doors (there are some bugs in the code right now)

4/22/23: 12:00AM
    >made more progress on the constructor for catacomb rooms. I have gotten the paths to connect correctly and generate a few additional red-herring paths,
     but something isn't quite right about the generation of the red-herring paths and I would like them to be more evenly spread throughout the map.
    >Also updated the catacomb constructor to place a button randomly on a path in the maze.

4/24/23: 10:30pm
    >made the function to enter and exit the catacombs from the overworld.
    >made the enterDoor() function that allows you to go between catacomb maps
    >started to incorporate player movement in the catacombs. Player can move in the 4 cardinal directions and when they hit a button it opens all the doors and when they walk over an entrance, they are brought to the overworld

4/30/23: 12:00AM
    >made the doors open correctly when traveling between maps
    >made the function that only prints out the catacomb map around the player (like a lamp)

5/1/23: 10:00PM
    CHANGED TO V5
    >made my catacomb mazes generate with better connection between doors

*********************************************************ASSIGNMENT 9*************************************************************************
4/16/23: 9:30pm
    >decreased the ammount of information printed when battling NPCs and reorgainzed a battling
    >Made the part of the NPC battle function that alloweds the user to flee the battle
    >Started to work on the part of the battle where the player and NPC use moves.
    >fixed an error where pokemon would spawn with the same moves (this was due to different moves being considered "different" depending on the game they were in reference to)
    >made it so if you press the 'B' button, you can use items on the menu
        >HOWEVER: this is very bad right now. I need to update it so that you can only call revive on dead pokemon and potions on live ones. Also do more to check for
         invalid input

4/18/23: 10:30pm
    >Implemented the switch pokemon option in the battle function
    >Implemented most of the battleWildPokemon function (all except capturing it and bag)
    >Got all but pokeballs working in the bag

4/19/23: 10:00AM
    >fully implemented pokemon and trainer battles
    >got the pokeballs to capture pokemon
    >made a few helper functions to check how many pokemon in a party were dead
    >updated the code so you can't run from trainer battles

    >made very short list of what to put in an inGame pokemon object

4/9/23: 11:00PM
    >transfered my files to an assignment 8 folder
    >implemented some of the code for creating a random pokemon, but got stuck on the statements

4/10/23: 11:30pm
    >finished making the code to randomly create a pokemon based on your location on the world map
    >made random pokemon have a 10% chance to spawn when walking through tall grass
    >made it so NPCs have pokemon when they spawn

4/11/23: 12:00pm
    >made the battle function print out the NPC's pokemon when you battle them
    >made the code that lets the player choose a starting pokemon
    >adjusted the inGamePokemon class to hold the IV values of each pokemon so that we can level them up correctly

4/12/23: 1:00pm
    >made code to level up a pokemon. This is called when the user enters the 'L' key
    >made it so that the players pokemon is printed out when you encounter a pokemon in the grass


*********************************************************ASSIGNMENT 7***************************************************************************
4/1/23: 1:00AM
    >Finally changed all of my structures into C++ classes and fixed all the errors associated with doing so
    >fixed the issue of the game freezing when you go back and forth between maps too quickly (it seemed to have something to do with a sentry spawning
    at (0,0) for some reason)

4/2/23: 8:00PM
    >Moved a lot of my functions into their respective classes for C++
    >did some research on file pointers in C++
    >Created the skelletons of my classes that will hold the information from the CSV files

4/5/23: 1:00AM
    >finished making my function to parse the csv files
    >made the code in main that will create the vector of the correct class type and print out the contents of the csv files
        >still need to make the int_max members of objects print as spaces though


*********************************************************ASSIGNMENT 6***************************************************************************
3/26/23: 3:00PM
    >made very bad pseudocode for a function that moves from map to map through gates
    >made very vague pseudocode for a fly function
    >attempted to transpose the code from C to C++ but failed miserably

3/27/23: 10:00PM
    >Started implementing a function that moves the player from map to map through gates (specifically through the north gate), but currently it seg faults

3/28/23: 11:00PM
    >Fixed the seg faults in the gates function and made all the gates work for each direction
    >Made better pseudo code for the fly function

3/29/23: 12:00AM
    >implemented fly method to go from map to map. Currently the player teleports to their current location on the new map, but I am gonna try to fix that

    >created a clearScreen() functiont that clears the Screen (it prints spaces everywhere)
    >created a displayTrainersList() function that prints all the trainers on the given map to the screen
    >made a battle() function that is called durring a battle. Currently it just sets the isDefeated value of the NPC you are battling to 1 and returns.
    >Tried to adjust the moveCharacters function to battle NPCs at the correct time, but I am running into a lot of issues

3/20/23:  3:33PM
    >fixed the battle mechanic so that you don't get caught in an infinite loop. The issue had to do with the fact that I was handling when an NPC runs 
    into the PC and the PC runs into an NPC the same way.

3/20/23: 10:00PM
    >added COLOR!!
    >updated my code so that when the user doesn't enter a number into the command line, 10 trainers are added to the map

3/21/23: 1:00PM

Known Errors:
    >Catacomb entrances sometimes don't spawn when they should (I entered through the overworld and there was no entrance
        where I spawned in the catacomb. This is likely due to a pathmaker overwritting it when it was making a path)
    >When I uncomment the "generateCharacters()" line when I leave the catacombs I sometimes get an infinite loop or a seg fault. [THE INFINITE LOOP IS THE CHARACTER MOVEMENT LOOP!!!]
